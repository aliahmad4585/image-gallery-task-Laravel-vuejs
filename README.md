# studydrive-image-gallery-task
Use Laravel and Vue.js (whichever version you prefer) to develop a picture gallery web application with the following functionality: • Registered users see all the pictures available. JSONPlaceholder Image API can be used to fetch fake data for this purpose. More detailed information about how to use this API can be found here. • Use a simple pagination for the navigation through the pictures. • Registered users can favorite/unfavorite pictures. • On Saturdays and Sundays, guest users see a list of the latest favorited photos picked by registered users. • On the remaining days, guest users see a list of the users that have favorited the most so far during the week.
